# FEWeb_Project_1
Udacity front-end web dev nanodegree first project: portal web page

This is the set of folders/files for my customized portal page to satisfy Project 1 requirements. I added an image folder
containing pictures I drew for the custom art work. There's not a lot of other customization but there are a lot of placeholders
for linking to future projects.
